# MLOps in Recommender Systems: Building a Continuous Training Pipeline with Concept Drift Awareness

Bachelor thesis of Sebastian SÃ¤tzler (SS 2022)

## Abstract
With the increase in adoption of machine learning (ML) in the enterprise sector, comes
a unique set of challenges that companies must face. Machine learning systems in
productive environments are subjected to unpredictable changes in the data and need
to conform to the iterative cycles of agile software development. In order to meet these
requirements, a paradigm shift in the development and operation of ML systems is
needed. The emergent field of MLOps sets out to introduce practices to make ML operations more efficient and maintainable. MLOps takes inspiration from principles of
DevOps and adapts them to the specific needs of ML. This research project serves as
a study of the current state of the art (SotA) for MLOps. Using the Design Science Research methodology, an MLOps pipeline is designed and implemented with TensorFlow Extended and Apache Airflow. The result of this thesis is a proof of concept of a
continuous training pipeline for a SotA recommendation system. This pipeline is designed to automatically relearn the recommender system upon detecting concept drift
through degradation of model performance.
